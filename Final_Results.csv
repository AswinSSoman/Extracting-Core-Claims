We developed a comprehensive four-step algorithm for identifying episodes of care for fall-related injuries and associated costs, using fee-for-service Medicare and Medicare Advantage health plan claims data for 2,011 patients from 5 medical groups between 2005 and 2009. First, as a preparatory step, we identified care received in acute inpatient and skilled nursing facility settings, in addition to emergency department visits. Second, based on diagnosis and procedure codes, we identified all fall-related claim records. Third, with these records, we identified six types of encounters for fall-related injuries, with different levels of injury and care. In the final step, we used these encounters to identify episodes of care for fall-related injuries. To illustrate the algorithm, we present a representative example of a fall episode and examine descriptive statistics of injuries and costs for such episodes. Altogether, we found that the results support the use of our algorithm for identifying episodes of care for fall-related injuries. When we decomposed an episode, we found that the details present a realistic and coherent story of fall-related injuries and healthcare services. Variation of episode characteristics across medical groups supported the use of a complex algorithm approach, and descriptive statistics on the proportion, duration, and cost of episodes by healthcare services and injuries verified that our results are consistent with other studies. This algorithm can be used to identify and analyze various types of fall-related outcomes including episodes of care, injuries, and associated costs. Furthermore, the algorithm can be applied and adopted in other fall-related studies with relative ease.","altogether, we found that the results support the use of our algorithm for identifying episodes of care for fall-related injuries.",,Correct,,"altogether, we found that the results support the use of our algorithm for identifying episodes of care for fall-related injuries.",,,Correct,,Yes,Yes,No,,Yes

Pilot interviews were completed with participants (n = 10) regarding their views on possible causes and treatments of GID. Participants (mainly young British people and students; n = 124) then completed a questionnaire that was based on the interviews and a review of the salient literature on lay theories. As hypothesized, participants believed most in biomedical causes and treatments of GID. Factor analysis (with varimax rotation) identified 4 factors in relation to causes of GID: upbringing and personal factors, pregnancy and brain abnormalities, environmental factors, and biomedical causes. Five factors that were identified in relation to the cure/treatment of GID were psychological assistance and personal factors, extreme medical and behavioral changes, alternative therapies, external factors, and medical treatments. The results indicated that participants neither agreed nor strongly disagreed about causes and cures regarding GID, but that these beliefs were logically related.

PVL expression by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is reportedly enhanced by ?-lactams, but inhibited by protein-synthesis inhibitors, a fact that has influenced management of infections associated with PVL. Although PVL is more frequently associated with MSSA than MRSA in the UK, the effect of antibiotics on PVL expression by MSSA has not been fully addressed. MSSA was cultured in vitro with varying concentrations of flucloxacillin, clindamycin or linezolid and PVL expression measured by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. A murine MSSA abscess model was developed to measure leucocidin expression in vivo following antibiotic treatment. 9% (27/314) of MSSA isolates from patients with uncomplicated community skin/soft tissue infections were positive for PVL genes (lukFS-PV). PVL expression by MSSA in broth was unaffected by varying concentrations of flucloxacillin, clindamycin or linezolid. In a murine abscess model, treatment with flucloxacillin did, however, enhance in vivo MSSA lukF-PV transcription and this was sustained even when flucloxacillin was combined with clindamycin, or clindamycin plus linezolid. Notwithstanding increased leucocidin transcription, functional leucotoxin activity was not enhanced. Treatment with flucloxacillin plus clindamycin significantly decreased leucotoxin activity, but the addition of a second protein synthesis inhibitor, linezolid, did not confer benefit.

Valproic acid and its sodium salt (divalproex) have been shown to be effective in preventing migraine in double-blind placebo-controlled studies. Gabapentin and lamotrigine have also been proposed for migraine prophylaxis, but more extensive studies are needed to confirm their efficacies. The main mechanism of action of anti-epileptic drugs is the inhibition of the sodium channel to induce a depolarization, preventing the high, frequent action potentials typically excited by convulsive attacks. Moreover, valproate and gabapentin increase brain concentrations of GABA and, probably, inhibit the degradation of GABA. Other proposed mechanisms of action for valproate are a direct effect on neuronal membranes and a reduction of excitatory transmission by aspartate. Valproate, at the recommended dose of 500 mg twice daily, is well tolerated. The more frequent unwanted effects associated with almost all drugs of this class are weight gain, drowsiness, dizziness and tremor.

However, even when abortion services are legal, women face social and cultural barriers to accessing safe abortion services and preventing unwanted pregnancy. Interpersonal communication interventions play an important role in overcoming these obstacles, including as part of broad educational- and behavioral-change efforts.

Furthermore, we examined the number of cells that grew and their motility by time-lapse imaging in order to clarify the interaction between the cells and SAMs. We hope that our results will be a basis for developing biodevices using living photosynthetic diatom cells.","glass surfaces were functionalized with -cf3, -ch3, -cooh, and -nh2 groups using the technique of self-assembled monolayers (sam), and diatom cells were subsequently cultured on these surfaces.",,Incorrect,,our data revealed that the velocity of the diatom cells in the unrinsed samples was higher than that in the rinsed samples after three days of incubation.,,,Incorrect,,No,Yes,No,,

In order to recommend best practices for information dissemination and diffusion, it is important to first study and analyze the networks. This study describes the characteristics of four medical networks, analyzes their theoretical dissemination potential, their actual dissemination, and the propagation and distribution of tweets. Open Twitter data was used to characterize four networks: the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the American College of Physicians (ACP). Data were collected between July 2012 and September 2012. Visualization was used to understand the follower overlap between the groups. Actual flow of the tweets for each group was assessed. Tweets were examined using Topsy, a Twitter data aggregator. The theoretical information dissemination potential for the groups is large. A collective community is emerging, where large percentages of individuals are following more than one of the groups. The overlap across groups is small, indicating a limited amount of community cohesion and cross-fertilization. The AMA followers’ network is not as active as the other networks. The AMA posted the largest number of tweets while the AAP posted the fewest. The number of retweets for each organization was low indicating dissemination that is far below its potential. To increase the dissemination potential, medical groups should develop a more cohesive community of shared followers. Tweet content must be engaging to provide a hook for retweeting and reaching potential audience. Next steps call for content analysis, assessment of the behavior and actions of the messengers and the recipients, and a larger-scale study that considers other medical groups using Twitter.","this study describes the characteristics of four medical networks, analyzes their theoretical dissemination potential, their actual dissemination, and the propagation and distribution of tweets.",,Incorrect,,"this study attempted to describe the characteristics of four medical networks and analyze their theoretical information dissemination potential, their actual information dissemination, their information sharers, and their propagation and distribution of tweets.",,,Incorrect,,No,No,No,,

With the rapid development of computer technology in recent years, there is an urgent need to prove whether item response theory–based computerized adaptive testing (CAT) can be applied to measure exposure to workplace bullying. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative efficiency and measurement precision of a CAT-based test for hospital nurses compared to traditional nonadaptive testing (NAT). Under the preliminary conditions of a single domain derived from the scale, a CAT module bullying scale model with polytomously scored items is provided as an example for evaluation purposes. A total of 300 nurses were recruited and responded to the 22-item Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised (NAQ-R). All NAT (or CAT-selected) items were calibrated with the Rasch rating scale model and all respondents were randomly selected for a comparison of the advantages of CAT and NAT in efficiency and precision by paired t tests and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The NAQ-R is a unidimensional construct that can be applied to measure exposure to workplace bullying through CAT-based administration. Nursing measures derived from both tests (CAT and NAT) were highly correlated (r=.97) and their measurement precisions were not statistically different (P=.49) as expected. CAT required fewer items than NAT (an efficiency gain of 32%), suggesting a reduced burden for respondents. There were significant differences in work tenure between the 2 groups (bullied and nonbullied) at a cutoff point of 6 years at 1 worksite. An AUROC of 0.75 (95% CI 0.68-0.79) with logits greater than –4.2 (or >30 in summation) was defined as being highly likely bullied in a workplace.

Further research into these trends will help to inform more focused policy and guidelines for doctors communicating with patients online. The intent of the study was to provide the first national profile of Australian doctors’ attitudes toward and use of online social media. The study involved a quantitative, cross-sectional online survey of Australian doctors using a random sample from a large representative database. Of the 1500 doctors approached, 187 participated (12.47%). Most participants used social media privately, with only one-quarter not using any social media websites at all (48/187, 25.7%). One in five participants (30/155, 19.4%) had received a “friend request” from a patient. There was limited use of online communication in clinical practice: only 30.5% (57/187) had communicated with a patient through email and fewer than half (89/185, 48.1%) could offer their patients electronic forms of information if that were the patients’ preference. Three in five participants (110/181, 60.8%) reported not being uncomfortable about interacting with patients who had accessed personal information about them online, prior to the consultation. Most of the participants (119/181, 65.8%) were hesitant to immerse themselves more fully in social media and online communication due to worries about public access and legal concerns. Doctors have different practices and views regarding whether or how to communicate appropriately with patients on the Internet, despite online and social media becoming an increasingly common feature of clinical practice. Additional training would assist doctors in protecting their personal information online, integrating online communication in patient care, and guidance on the best approach in ethically difficult online situations.","doctors have different practices and views regarding whether or how to communicate appropriately with patients on the Internet, despite online and social media becoming an increasingly common feature of clinical practice.",,Correct,,objective\nthe intent of the study was to provide the first national profile of australian doctors\u2019 attitudes toward and use of online social media.,,,Incorrect,,No,No,Yes,,

Coupling VE with high-speed networking [Tele-Immersion] that approaches speeds of 100 Gb/sec can greatly expand its influence in rehabilitation. Accordingly, these new networks will permit various peripherals attached to computers on this network to be connected and to act as fast as if connected to a local PC. This innovation may soon allow the development of previously unheard of networked rehabilitation systems. Rapid advances in this technology need to be coupled with an understanding of how human behavior is affected when immersed in the VE. This paper will discuss various forms of VE that are currently available for rehabilitation. The characteristic of these new networks and examine how such networks might be used for extending the rehabilitation clinic to remote areas will be explained. In addition, we will present data from an immersive dynamic virtual environment united with motion of a posture platform to record biomechanical and physiological responses to combined visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive inputs. A 6 degree-of-freedom force plate provides measurements of moments exerted on the base of support. Kinematic data from the head, trunk, and lower limb was collected using 3-D video motion analysis. Our data suggest that when there is a confluence of meaningful inputs, neither vision, vestibular, or proprioceptive inputs are suppressed in healthy adults; the postural response is modulated by all existing sensory signals in a non-additive fashion. Individual perception of the sensory structure appears to be a significant component of the response to these protocols and underlies much of the observed response variability. The ability to provide new technology for rehabilitation services is emerging as an important option for clinicians and patients. The use of data mining software would help analyze the incoming data to provide both the patient and the therapist with evaluation of the current treatment and modifications needed for future therapies. Quantification of individual perceptual styles in the VE will support development of individualized treatment programs. The virtual environment can be a valuable tool for therapeutic interventions that require adaptation to complex, multimodal environments.","our data suggest that when there is a confluence of meaningful inputs, neither vision, vestibular, or proprioceptive inputs are suppressed in healthy adults; the postural response is modulated by all existing sensory signals in a non-additive fashion.",,Correct,,"results\nour data suggest that when there is a confluence of meaningful inputs, neither vision, vestibular, or proprioceptive inputs are suppressed in healthy adults; the postural response is modulated by all existing sensory signals in a non-additive fashion.",,,Correct,,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes

To determine whether HIV-1 infection influences the protein composition of human synapses, a proteomic study of isolated nerve endings was undertaken. Synaptosomes from frontal neocortex were isolated using isopyknic centrifugation from 19 human brain specimens. Purity and enrichment were assessed by measuring pre- and postsynaptic protein markers. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to screen for proteins differentially expressed in HIV/AIDS. The concentrations of 31 candidate protein spots were potentially abnormal in HIV-infected decedents with HIV encephalitis and/or increased expression of immunoproteasome subunits. Immunoblots showed that the concentration of some of them was related to HIV-1 infection of the brain and immunoproteasome (IPS) induction. Synapsin 1b and stathmin were inversely related to brain HIV-1 load; 14-3-3? and 14-4-4? proteins were higher in subjects with HIV-1 loads. Perturbed synaptosome proteins were linked with IPS subunit composition, and 14-3-3? was histologically colocalized with IPS subunits in stained neocortical neurons.

The present study investigated whether personality traits might be recognized using olfactory cues in contexts other than male–female interactions. 75 children (35 girls and 40 boys, M = 8.29 years) and 75 young adults (41 women and 34 men, M = 20.5 years) rated the personality traits of 50 unknown individuals (24 women and 26 men, M = 24.02 years) based on their body odor. The correlations between scent ratings and the self-assessed personality dimensions of odor donors were analyzed. The results show that both children and adults assess neuroticism relatively accurately, whereas only adults recognized dominance.

Functionalization was achieved by incorporating pH/temperature-responsive polyelectrolyte microgels into the textile surface layer using UV irradiation. The aim of functionalization was to regulate polyester wettability according to ambient conditions by imparting stimuli-responsiveness from the microgel to the textile itself. Microgels consisted of pH/thermo-responsive microparticles of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) either alone or complexed with the pH-responsive natural polysaccharide chitosan. Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, ?-potential measurements, and topographical analysis were used for surface characterization. Wettability of polyester textiles was assessed by dynamic wetting, water vapor transfer, and moisture regain measurements. One of the main findings showed that the polyester surface was rendered pH-responsive, both in acidic and alkaline pH region, owing to the microgel incorporation. With a marked relaxation in their structure and an increase in their microporosity, the functionalized textiles exhibited higher water vapor transfer rates both at 20 and 40 °C, and 65% relative humidity compared with the reference polyester. Also, at 40 °C, i.e., above the microgel Lower Critical Solution Temperature, the functionalized polyester textiles had lower moisture regains than the reference. Finally, the type of the incorporated microgel affected significantly the polyester total absorption times, with an up to 300% increase in one case and an up to 80% decrease in another case.
